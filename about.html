<h1>Bible verses</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jeremiah 9:23–24</strong> Thus says the Lord: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the Lord.</li>
    <li><strong>1 Corinthians 9:19</strong> Even though I am a free man with no master, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ.</li>
